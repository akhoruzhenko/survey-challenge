# survey-challenge

## Problem Statement
Let's imagine we've decided to write a new survey microservice. We're starting with an MVP
that will have the following features:
- Create a survey with multiple-choice questions
- Disable some question(s) in the survey (we should not delete any questions)
- TODO: Answer a surveyâ€™s questions
- TODO: Get the relative distribution of a selected answer by question
